I could not decide what to do with stream_filemetaelements so I left it as an
option. I do not believe most people actually care about the internal of the
file meta information.

Advanced user (and some filter) can turn it on. This makes it trivial to
reproduce behavior of tools such as dcdump/dcmdump or dicomdump.
